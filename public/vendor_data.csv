I&rsquo;ve been serving sweet couples for five years, and have been a part of over 100 wedding days! I&rsquo;ve been featured in international publications and recently inducted into The Knot Hall of Fame(it's kind of like winning a Grammy). I truly LOVE getting to know my couples and celebrating with them on their #bestdayever. I&rsquo;m basically your behind-the-scenes bridesmaid with a camera who will probably ugly-cry at your wedding.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">MY PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE?&nbsp;<br />IT&rsquo;S JOYFUL, TIMELESS, AND ROMANTIC&ndash;BUT MOSTLY JOYFUL!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">My goal is to make your day EASY and ENJOYABLE. I love candid moments, you know, when mom is crying in the front row, or when your groom sees you for the first time-but I also love to create beautiful images of couples with light posing involved to make you look your best (don&rsquo;t worry, these won&rsquo;t look like your yearbook pictures)! Your wedding day should be full of joy, love, and lots of laughter, and I think your photos should reflect that.&nbsp;</p>

7357,At Last Entertainment,At Last Entertainment,"<h2>I have a decade of experience doing events &ndash; weddings are my specialty. &nbsp;I am very detail oriented in the planning and execution of an event. &nbsp;I bring the fun and the energy to your guests and bring the calm and confidence to my bride and groom.</h2>
<p>Here is a little about me and my thoughts about weddings. &nbsp;When we meet, I want to focus on getting to know you &ndash; how you met and hearing about your plans, thoughts, ideas and dreams of what your perfect wedding day looks like.</p>
<p>Hiring wedding vendors can be a daunting task! &nbsp;The DJ tends to be a very personality-based decision; you can&rsquo;t walk the grounds, admire a portfolio or do a tasting.&nbsp; I have found it best to set up a face-to-face meeting and see if my personality is a good match to your expectations.&nbsp; After all, the DJ will not only be providing the background for your entire event, he/she will also be the voice of your wedding.&nbsp; A <em>good</em> DJ will also be your &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; person for any and everything during your event.&nbsp; Having someone with a personality suited to yours can prove to be an invaluable asset. &nbsp;And oh&hellip;how a bad DJ can be your worst nightmare. &nbsp;I hear horror stories all the time and it breaks my heart how one person can do so much damage to an event.</p>
<p>I have been DJ&rsquo;ing since &lsquo;07 and have hundreds and hundreds of weddings under my belt. &nbsp;Experience&hellip; there is nothing better to prepare you for the things a wedding ceremony and reception can throw at you.&nbsp; My goal for my bride and groom is to have no idea of anything other than perfection&hellip;even if that may not have been entirely the case behind the scenes.&nbsp; I want you to spend your event in a bubble of bliss and if there is some drama, there is rarely a need for it to have any effect on the 2 people who have been planning this day for months or years. &nbsp;Almost everything that goes off course, can be corrected without popping your bubble.</p>
<p>All I want my bride to have to worry about on the day of her wedding is to look pretty. &nbsp;The rest of the event &ndash; leave up to me and the other professionals you have hired to deliver the day you have dreamt of all your life.&nbsp; Because once the day finally arrives, you don&rsquo;t want to worry about linens, chiffon chairs, cake flavors or center pieces.&nbsp; All you should have to worry about is soaking up the moment: enjoying your last hours being single, your mother and grandmother there telling you about <em>their</em> wedding day (again), finally putting on the dress you chose after the hundreds you looked at and the dozens you tried on, blasting your favorite music with your girls as you all get ready together, did your fiance and the groomsmen make it back from the golf course (ok&hellip;maybe not that last one).</p>
<p>I truly enjoy what I do!&nbsp; I love meeting engaged couples and hearing about your ideas and plans and discussing how we can make them a reality and perhaps even enhance them to places you had not thought of before.&nbsp; I love the process of choosing the music that will be the backdrop to the event: the ceremony, the first dance, the parents&rsquo; dance, the bouquet and garter&hellip;or whatever events you choose to incorporate into your night.&nbsp; I have worked with couples who know every song from the minute the first guest arrives to those who have not even thought of that part yet.&nbsp; I am happy to take notes and listen or to share ideas and help brainstorm songs that might fit the mood you are going for at each phase.</p>
<p>I have been to more weddings in a month than most people attend in their lifetime.&nbsp; There is no right or wrong way to do things.&nbsp; There are logistical parts of weddings that perhaps you have not thought of &ndash; but ultimately anything I ever suggest can be met with, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s interesting&hellip;we don&rsquo;t want to do that&rdquo; and it will not bother me at all.&nbsp; I will talk through each scenario to find a solution that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t point you toward a potential pitfall.</p>
<p>Lastly, wedding DJ and club DJ are 2 very different skill sets.&nbsp; I think either would be challenged doing the other job.&nbsp; Club DJs typically stay within the current music, and do a lot of beat mixing for mostly the same age crowd with the same music tastes &ndash; whatever that club&rsquo;s genre might be.&nbsp; Although I do some beat-mixing, a wedding DJ has to consider the 3 to 4 generations attending your wedding.&nbsp; Grandma doesn&rsquo;t want to hear the same music your 14 year old niece wants to hear, and your guests who ride horses for fun don&rsquo;t generally listen to the same music as your guests who ride Harleys for fun.&nbsp; The ability to read the room is key once everyone hits the dance floor. &nbsp;I know budget restraints might cause you to think an uncle with an iPod is a good option, but the MC job is the most challenging aspect for a wanna-be DJ. &nbsp;Love Shack will sound the same if I play it or your uncle plays it&hellip;but addressing the hundreds of strangers in the room on a microphone is outside of most people&rsquo;s comfort zone. &nbsp;One needs to log a few hours to really become comfortable at it. &nbsp;Just for the record, I&rsquo;m not crazy about Love Shack &ndash; the music you don&rsquo;t want to hear is equally as important as the &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to play or you&rsquo;re fired&rdquo; songs on your list.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the easiest part of the night is once we open up the dance floor, but that is what most people think of first when they think of the DJ.&nbsp; Where you get the most out of your wedding DJ is keeping your event on pace, keeping everyone informed of what is going on, and (most important) keeping key players aware of what is coming next. &nbsp;No surprises&hellip;unless planned. &nbsp;This in turn keeps everyone calm, knowing your DJ has the event well in hand; and my bride and groom can be in the moment and soak up every minute of the event.&nbsp; In the blink of an eye &ndash; you will be back in your honeymoon suite looking at your rings and giggling about calling each other husband and wife.</p>",dominic@atlastent.com,Bride to Be San Antonio Weddings,dominic@atlastent.com,https://www.facebook.com/atlastent/,6.211E+14,@atlastentertainment,,At Last Entertainment - San Antonio Weddings DJ,At Last Entertainment - San Antonio Weddings DJ,At Last Entertainment - San Antonio Weddings DJ,2109069331,,210-906-9331,

<p>New Iberia, Louisiana born and raised. Currently located in San Antonio, TX. I've had a passion for art since the age of 4. Drawing and painting on anyone or anything i could find. I find peace in art and makeup artistry fell into that place. Faces are my canvas. I love that feeling of getting lost into what I'm creating at that moment. I am also a model. It wasn't until my model coach told me years ago that i had to lean to do my own makeup because not everyone will know how to shade match me, that i took it seriously. I am self taught with celebrity MUA's training under my belt. As time goes by I learn more in my craft. You never stop learning your passion.

I discovered my passion for photography and weddings, and have been enjoying my career ever since--especially since branching out into my own business in 2008. I look at every photography session, and every event I capture as a unique experience--one to learn from and have fun with. Your wedding will not be just another job for me, but a special day that I have the opportunity to be a part of. You are not just another client, but a bride getting ready for the most exciting day of her life!<br /> <br /> It is so important to have a good relationship with your photographer--they will share some of the most emotional, stressful, and wonderful moments of your life. I enjoy building a relationship with you, so that you are relaxed and having fun on your wedding day, not worrying about a camera in your face!<br /> <br /> Besides my passion for photography, I also specialize in (and really enjoy!) portrait design. What will you do with your portraits? I am a firm believer in your rights to own your images, and you will always receive an image CD with my services. But what comes next? Will you print a bunch of 4x6s just to put them into a box in your closet? This is where my special design abilities come into play. I will sit down with you for a design consultation after the wedding, and then create a beautiful custom album to tell the story of your day, with your personal style in mind. Many photographers send their designs out to an anonymous graphic designer, that you will never meet--I know YOU, and design unique creations with you in mind. Many of my brides choose me for my personal service AND design ability all in one, and most decide to let me take care of everything for them, from their fun Save the Date magnets or cards to their unique custom Invitations and Guestbooks, a special Boudoir Book for their husband to be, and even personal Thank You card designs. The Wedding Album is the final result of months of getting to know you throughout our sessions, meeting, and design consults, to make that special design just for you.<br /> <br /> Please take some time to look at my website--I know you will be happy with what you see! My portraits and custom designs speak for themselves, and you will find out how easy it is to be able to invest in beautiful, artistic, and personalized photography for your wedding.<br /> </span></span></span></p>

As a singer, band leader, emcee, DJ and KJ, she has seen most every event happen from the inside out. While performing at numerous weddings, receptions and events, she realized that many times there was a great frustration behind the scenes. Generally, those with the most to celebrate&nbsp;are the ones stressed to the max and worried about the details. While planning her own wedding, she knew she had a knack for&nbsp;making beautiful&nbsp;things happen. Friends and family saw her passion and attention to detail, and quickly began asking for assistance. Many wedding and events later, she decided to follow her passion. She studied Wedding and Event Planning through QC Event Career School and received her diploma and an Award of Merit for outstanding creative ability.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><span class=""wixGuard""></span>Jill also has many years of experience in the fashion industry as a buyer for a major American-branded company. She prides herself in staying current with the trends and she always listens&nbsp;to what the customer wants. She has an outstanding record of customer service, and is anxious to bring that enthusiasm to each and every client, family and vendor she works with. Jill would love to help turn your vision into a reality. When you hire Jill, you hire a friend and an advocate for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joe Caruso and his superb trio (piano, bass and drums) perform swingin' standards from various eras.</p>
<p>Songs include: ""The Way You Look Tonight,"" ""Fly Me To the Moon,"" ""New York State of Mind"" and ""What A Wonderful World.""</p>
<p>Swinging the Great American Songbook, as well as other pop standards and love songs, Joe relies on a vocal technique called the bel canto (Italian, ""beautiful singing"") method. Tony Bennett once said that as a student of this discipline, he was taught to get to the center of the note, and that this is the essence of bel canto singing. A protege of Mr. Bennett, Joe is renowned for his great phrasing, clarity of diction and sheer thrill of sound.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""font_8""><span class=""color_15"">Hello and welcome to Khalil &amp; Co. I'm so excited you're considering us to make you look and feel beautiful. Since I'll (hopefully) be getting to know you personally as a lot of our customers become not only clients but friends, here is a little bit about who I am and how this company started.</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">&nbsp;<span class=""color_15"">I grew up in San Antonio, Texas and went to school and graduated from the Mays School of Business with a Bachelors in Supply Chain Management from&nbsp;Texas A&amp;M University.</span></p>
<p class=""font_8""><span class=""color_15"">When&nbsp;I was in college I spent 2.5 years as a glamour model. I've been published in all sorts of amazing magazines including Maxim.com and Maxim.co.za (Maxim South Africa). Once I became pregnant with my handsome baby boy (that is now 4!)&nbsp;I decided to leave that life behind me, finish my degree, and get the logistics job I had always dreamed of.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""font_8""><span class=""color_15""><span class=""wixGuard""></span></span><span class=""color_15"">Once I was in the job I felt something missing. In August of 2015 I opened up as Adriana Khalil Makeup Artistry only having one client for the entire month. There was some sort of happiness I got from making that one girl look and feel beautiful that I decided to keep on and start marketing my services. I quickly grew and I was constantly asked to bring a hairstylist with me...&nbsp;and from there Khalil &amp; Co. was born. Now we are a collection of makeup artists and hairstylists that become your glamour team. One year after opening we were named by TheKnot.com as the Best of Weddings for 2017. We just received the award again for 2018!</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">&nbsp;<span class=""color_15"">With that being said, I am excited to start this journey with you.&nbsp; Please contact me with any and every question you may have and I hope to meet you soon.</span></p>

7519,Linda Rukavina Photography,Linda Rukavina Photography,"<p>First things first, as a wedding photographer, I have to make it clear that I cherish love....in ALL it's forms. I do not discriminate on your relationship. I do not sit in judgment because, honestly...how can you judge love? You come to me because you want to celebrate that you have found the one you want to live the journey of life with, and that makes me so proud to be a part of it. I am happy to give EVERYONE a great experience and amazing images to last forever. Everyone who works within my company has the same attitude toward love, and you'll never have to worry about judgement here. Now that that is said...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you looking for a unique experience with a skilled photographer who can handle anything? Then look no further! If you are looking for a fad photographer who relies on Photoshop to either fix errors that should have been corrected in camera to begin with or to make their images sale-able? Then please, stop reading...OK, now you serious photo peeps, I am happy to tell you about what to expect at Rukavina Photography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are primarily, a wedding photography studio, but that does not mean that we can not shoot your seniors, families, babies, maternity, fashion etc. We love everyone and have trained in every genre of photography, so we are well equipped to handle anything you&nbsp; may need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We make it our mission, in our work, to bring joy to the lives of those we shoot. What is it that we want to remember? It is the emotion of the moment, whether it be the sweet calm of a newborn baby, the giddy laughter of a child, the excitement of the unknown and promising future of a graduating senior, the beauty of true love at an engagement or wedding? Why, all of it, of course! We, as photographers, can sometimes forget that we are shooting people, most of these images are not for magazine covers or awards. We are capturing a memory for you. A memory that will never come into our lives again...That is an amazing gift your are giving us. We get caught up in the thrill of victory that we sometimes forget to capture humanity. That is something that we promise you that we will never forget. ;)</p>
<p>Since you're probably here to learn about my work, and not my philosophy on life, I'll get started...</p>
<p>&nbsp;My love of photography began as a child. The magic of capturing a moment in time has always been exciting for me. For some reason, however, I started out as a Fine Art major in college. After a few semesters, I changed it to my first love...photography.&nbsp;I realized that I was no Michelangelo (who happens to be my favorite Renaissance Man) when I tried sculpting and I certainly needed help with my painting skills. Thankfully, I had a great couple of Art professors who had a ton&nbsp;of patience. The skills I learned there, definitely help me in my creation of art digitally. I also learned from&nbsp;my Photography professors that no amount of digital manipulation can fix an image if you don't master the light first. This involved studying not only natural light, but off camera flash, strobes and creating light in unusual ways. I&nbsp;can't sculpt like Michelangelo, as I said before, but I certainly have learned to sculpt my subjects with light!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After college, I&nbsp;just knew I was going to be a world-renowned photographer immediately because my passion was so strong. However, a person has got to eat, so life got in the way a bit :) But, thanks to my incredible husband and family, I was able to pick up where I left off after my youngest was born in 2006.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am the luckiest person in the world. I get to earn a living doing something that I not only have a passion for, but it is what I was&nbsp;<em>meant&nbsp;</em>to do. It is a rare gift to be able to follow your passion, and I recognize that with every shoot.Nothing makes me feel more alive than when I am creating my own little masterpieces.</p>
<p>I use my background in art to help me create the images that you see in my portfolio to this day. Mastering lighting techniques to create the mood you want is a very difficult, but extremely rewarding experience. I enjoy discovering where the image takes me in post-processing as well. Michelangelo once said, "" Every block of stone has a statue inside it, and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it."" He was also smart enough to realize that he was still learning. I use&nbsp;the examples of the masters of the past and try my best to take a little bit of&nbsp;their genius and apply&nbsp;that standard of excellence to my work. I am constantly studying new techniques and I keep up to date with the latest ideas, however, I am not one to rely on fad techniques. I can, and often do, use new techniques to create an edgy image, but I can also sculpt the light, which is a must in this profession. You can be assured that I&nbsp;have studied many years and I&nbsp;take this very seriously, even though I come off as a big ole goofball most of the time ;).&nbsp;I push myself every day to become better and better. That is something that HAS to be done in this business.&nbsp;Aside from the fundamental skills and knowledge&nbsp;required to be a professional photographer, the only&nbsp; aspect of this job that you can bet on is that it is constantly&nbsp;changing and growing to new heights. It's very exciting!</p>
<p>I enjoy this ""job"" so much that it does not seem like work to me at all. I have a great time, and I make it my mission to make sure my customers have a great time also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I greatly appreciate you taking the time to get to know a little about me and my work. I can promise you that I give everything I have to these portraits and I am always willing to listen to your input. After all, you are the subject of my work! I look forward to working with you all and I thank you in advance for allowing me the opportunity to be part of your lives, even if it's just for a moment!</p>

<h2><span class=""s1"">When I was little and went to my aunts, uncles, or any of my mom&rsquo;s friends&rsquo; houses, I used to immediately look for their wedding portraits. Even at a young age, I knew that these images told a story. I loved being able to imagine these big days through the eyes of the people who lived them.</span></h2>
<h2><span class=""s1"">Now that I&rsquo;m all grown up, I still love to look at these images, and now I have the extra joy of sharing them with my own children.</span></h2>
<h2><span class=""s1"">It makes perfect sense that I&rsquo;ve dedicated my life to capturing these precious moments, because I know that&nbsp;<strong>these images will become family heirlooms.</strong></span></h2>
<h2><span class=""s1"">When I&rsquo;m snapping that beautifully posed portrait of your new husband kissing your forehead, I&rsquo;m imagining a few years down the road when your kids will look at that portrait hanging on the wall and imagine this perfect day.</span></h2>
<h2><span class=""s1"">I believe in treating clients like family and building relationships prior to the wedding or quinceanera day. So don&rsquo;t be surprised when I start tearing up as dad twirls the quince girl, or the new Mr. and Mrs. share their first kiss.&nbsp;<strong>It&rsquo;s a joy to watch your most treasured stories unfold.</strong></span></h2>",patysphoto@gmail.com,Bride to Be San Antonio,patysphoto@gmail.com,https://www.facebook.com/patyaraujophotography/,2.21093E+14,https://www.instagram.com/patyaraujophotography/,https://www.pinterest.com/pattie_89/,Paty Araujo Photography,Paty Araujo Photography - Weddings and Engagements in San Antonio,Paty Araujo Photography,2108615055,,2108615055,

7619,Stone Oak Jewelers,Stone Oak Jewelers,"<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">In years past, people buying diamonds had to put their faith and trust into their jeweler. They would have to take their jeweler's word for the characteristics and value of a stone--and hope that their jeweler was accurate. </span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">Even with the most honest jeweler in the world, though, it can be a bit nerve-wracking to make a purchase this big and this expensive!when all you have to rely on is someone's word.</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">While Dan Dement has earned his outstanding reputation as a jeweler by being 100% honest with his clientele, he now has technology on his side to <em>prove</em> his word. With the latest and most innovative advances in diamond grading technology, Dan can show his clients the exact specifications of any stone they're considering for purchase which leaves nothing uncertain, nothing to chance, and nothing to human error.</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">Chances are, you've heard about the 4 Cs of diamonds: clarity, color, carat weight, and cut. There is a plethora of literature out there to educate you on the importance of each, and how each can affect the total value of a diamond.</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible for someone with an untrained eye to pick out the subtle and sometimes miniscule differences in carat weight, color, and clarity that can cause dramatic variations in price and value. That means you're left to rely on the experts who are human too,and sometime subject to error.</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">This is, in part, why it is so critical that you buy a GIA certified diamond from a GIA certified jeweler. The GIA (Gemological Institute of America) is the world's largest and most respected non-profit institute of gemological research and learning. When dealing with a jeweler who has been designated as a Graduate Gemologist by the GIA as Dan Dement, owner of <a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""http://sanantonioweddings.com/addwebsitestats.aspx?id=830"">Stone Oak Jewelers</a>&nbsp;has been, you can be assured that you're dealing with a jeweler who is instantly recognized around the world as the mark of a senior professional in the jewelry industry. </span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">Aside from the knowledge that you're working with one of the best in the industry, <a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""http://sanantonioweddings.com/addwebsitestats.aspx?id=830"">Stone Oak Jewelers</a> offers a number of other things to put their clients minds at ease when making such a large purchase. With any GIA certified diamond you purchase at <a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""http://sanantonioweddings.com/addwebsitestats.aspx?id=830"">Stone Oak Jewelers</a>, you will receive a GIA certification that spells out the exact characteristics of that particular stone. Because these measurements are made by various diamond grading machines, there is very little left to human error, and thus, no guessing about the accuracy of the weight, color, or clarity of a stone. </span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">However, as beneficial as these certifications are, they leave out the final and possibly the most important C: Cut.</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">Cut is often thought of as simply the shape of the diamond: round, square, triangular, etc. In reality, however, the cut refers to so much more: proportion, symmetry, and finish, as the pros say. Very basically, a diamond's cut is what gives the stone its brilliance, and allows it to reflect the ideal amount of light. If the stone is cut is too shallow or too deep, the diamond will reflect less light and lose brilliance and thus, lose value. </span><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">An otherwise perfect stone can be drastically devalued by a poor cut.</span> </strong><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">But if a GIA certification doesn't grade the cut of a diamond, how do you know that you are purchasing a well-cut diamond?</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">Well, the GIA <em>is</em> working on adding a Cut grade to their certifications. In the meantime, however, there is a way for you to know the exact cut of the diamond you are purchasing.</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;""><a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""http://sanantonioweddings.com/addwebsitestats.aspx?id=830"">Stone Oak Jewelers</a> is the <strong>only jeweler in town</strong> with the technology to show you exactly how a diamond is cut. You can take any loose stone, and within seconds, they will show digital 3-D model of that stone, it's precise measurements, and the exact way in which it absorbs and reflects light (or, how much light it leaks or loses). This technology illuminates the final C in diamond grading. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Combined with the GIA certification for a diamond, it takes the guesswork and the human error out of judging the value of a diamond. You know, without a doubt, the exact specifications of the stone you are purchasing.</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;"">Don't leave a purchase this big and this important to chance. Come see Dan and his staff, and let them show you how this technology works. Once you see it, you won't risk buying a diamond from anyone else.</span></p>",dadement@swbell.net,,dadement@swbell.net,,1.93953E+11,https://www.instagram.com/stoneoakjewelers/,,Stone Oak Jewelers Wedding rings san antonio,"At Stone Oak Jewelers,  don't leave a purchase this important to chance.","stone oak jewelers, wedding rings, engagement rings, wedding bands, san antonio, tx, stone oak jewelers, wedding jewelry, anniversary, necklace, gold, silver, pearls, titanium, platinum, san antonio, tx, stone oak gifts, wedding",2104033900,,NULL,

<p>I have always loved love. Growing up I was a fan of Rom Coms, having crushes and puppy love. At that same time,&nbsp;I was developing my love and passion for art, design and printed pieces. I found my dream career path and have been on it since early in college. Then, it happened. I fell completely in love. We got engaged, planned a wedding, and celebrated the best day of our lives together.</p>
<p>During that planning phase, I developed my own stationery, from save the dates, to thank you cards, signs, favor tags, fans and more. I fell in love with the wedding industry and soon after my wedding, I began designing wedding stationery as my gift for my friends&rsquo; special day. It was such a wonderful feeling to help make someone else&rsquo;s dreams come true.</p>
<h3>Let&rsquo;s Work Together.</h3>
<p>Now, I want to help make your dreams come true! My intentions are to create the best printed pieces you can imagine and help bring your special day fully together, from start until happily ever after. Remember this is YOUR day! If you have a passion for horses, we can do that. Super Mario? We can do it. Harry Potter? We can definitely do that! Romantic? Traditional? We can do that!</p>
<p>Be true to yourself. Do what is the best fit for you and makes you the happiest!</p>

Congratulations on your engagement. I hope you enjoy every moment of it and may your special day be truly magical.</em>&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Let&rsquo;s start with a little more about me ~ I am a native Texan born in Carrizo Springs, TX. I grew up in Houston and later moved with my family to the place I now call my home, San Antonio, TX!</em>&nbsp;<br /><em>I have a wonderful husband, daughter, and son who all support my love and passion for planning weddings and events.&nbsp; </em></em><br /><br /><em>I discovered my passion as I was planning my own wedding and assisting others plan their beautiful weddings. Each was truly a magical moment for me. &nbsp;I am always looking forward to the next beautiful wedding or event to plan.</em><br /><br /><em>I obtained my certification as a wedding &amp; event planner through <strong>Lovegevity&rsquo;s Wedding Planning Institute</strong>in September of 2010. &nbsp;At that time I also started my business as a wedding planner &nbsp;and began working part-time at Granberry Hills Event Center. I have been blessed to have coordinated over 200+ weddings at Granberry. I have met some wonderful couples, great vendors and we made many dream weddings come true. I have been blessed to have turned my passion for planning into a reality. &nbsp;I departed from Granberry Hills in June 2015 to devote all my time to my business and to my couples.</em><br /><br /><em>Now, a little more about my work ~ I firmly believe the planning process of your big day should be fun and stress free. I like to make sure you feel comfortable working with me and in sharing all the details with me. &nbsp;I love getting to know my couples as well as meeting your families during the planning process of your beautiful wedding.</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em> <em>I strive to provide the highest quality of service I possibly can to make your wedding the best day ever!</em></em><br /><br /><em>I have worked with many types of couples that you can think of. Over the top weddings, small romantic affairs, weddings on a budget, multi-cultural celebrations, you name it, I&rsquo;ve done it! My ample experience will allow me to bring your wedding day vision and dreams to reality.&nbsp; At the end of the day, I hope that my passion for your wedding will show every step of the way leading up to your wedding day.</em><em>&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><br /><em>Want more information? I&rsquo;d love to hear from you. &nbsp;Simply complete our contact form and I will get in touch with you as soon as possible. &nbsp;You may also contact us at 210.887.8327 or email us at&nbsp;<a title="""" href=""mailto:pamela@wedbypamela.com"">pamela@wedbypamela.com</a>. </em><br /><br /><em>Let Us Be A Part of Your Happily Ever After!
